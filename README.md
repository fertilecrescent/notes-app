# notes-app
A CRUD web app for taking notes, similar to the notes app on iPhone


## Demonstration
The entry point to the application is a list of all of the user's folders

![the first view that the user sees when accessing the app](/demo-images/entry_point.png)

To add a folder, click the green folder icon

![the input dialogue for entering the name of a new folder](/demo-images/enter_folder_name.png)

Type your folder's desired name into the input dialogue, and hit enter. As a result, you will see a container which will display all of the notes for that particular folder

To add a note, click the green button under the notes container

![the input dialogue for entering the name of a new note](/demo-images/enter_note_name.png)

Type your note's desired name into the input dialogue, and hit enter.
You can now begin editing the content of your note.

![the text area for editing the content of a note. it's blank in this case](/demo-images/begin_typing.png)

If you navigate elsewhere within the app (e.g. to another note, or another folder) then the contents of this text area will be saved.
They also will be saved if you hit the \<Enter\> key
