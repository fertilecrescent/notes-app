Type your folder's desired name into the input dialogue, and hit enter. As a result, you will see a container which will display all of the notes for that particular folder

You can now begin editing the content of your note.

If you navigate elsewhere within the app (e.g. to another note, or another folder) then the contents of this text area will be saved.
They also will be saved if you hit the \<Enter\> key

Clicking on a folder will display its notes
