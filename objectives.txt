(check) display a list of folders and get the style looking good (fake data for now)
make it work with the database
    (check) create a folder schema
    (check) write code for connecting to the database
    (check) configure and use a .env folder for your database password and hit it from github
    (check) write DB endpoints for adding, retrieving, and deleting folders
    display folders on the frontend

        we'll need a function that fetches the appropriate URL (GET root + folders/)
        make sure you save the root url as a variable at the top of the file (localhost:3000 for now)
        a javascript function gets the folders as a list from the server
            NOTE: wouldn't it be better to have the REST API and the server on the same machine?
        loop through .folder elements assigning their folder name (later you can do sorting)


    delete folders from the frontend
        each .folder has a button
            we'll need to make it look good
        when we assign names to .folder, we also assign a click event callback function to the button,  which fetches the appropriate api endpoint (DELETE root + folders/ + name/)
            when it returns, we should remove .folder from the frontend, or display an error message (just do it as an alert() for now)
        
    add folders from the frontend
    and that's it...
