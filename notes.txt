Can you give a width to an item that is inline?
Oh wow, my study of css has already come to help me.  I understood how to use padding and box-sizing to get the correct size for my border.
Bro...you need to do that thing where the page display automatically updates upon file changes.
Random idea...don't be afraid to have a 'utils' module...it's not a sin.
Research decimal point px values (seems to work?)
I was born to make simple UIs with old school colors (pastels!)
When using calc(), addition and subtraction characters must surrounded by whitespace (who knew)!
Research fonts...which are built in, which are cross platform, importing fonts...
Research stylistic use of fonts (font theory?)
It'd be better to design things ahead of time in figma...
