Can you give a width to an item that is inline?
Oh wow, my study of css has already come to help me.  I understood how to use padding and box-sizing to get the correct size for my border.
Bro...you need to do that thing where the page display automatically updates upon file changes.
Random idea...don't be afraid to have a 'utils' module...it's not a sin.
Research decimal point px values (seems to work?)
I was born to make simple UIs with old school colors (pastels!)
When using calc(), addition and subtraction characters must surrounded by whitespace (who knew)!
Research fonts...which are built in, which are cross platform, importing fonts...
Research stylistic use of fonts (font theory?)
It'd be better to design things ahead of time in figma...
How to I configure VS code to not give me warnings when I use 'require()'?
What does the HTML 'disabled' attribute do?
Apparently disabling an element doesn't keep its click events from firing.
pointer-events
    The pointer-events CSS property sets under what circumstances (if any) a particular graphic element can become the target of pointer events.
Bruh you should look into javascript formatting/ers
Bruh you should study SVG
You need to research about accessing the stylesheet through javascript
What's the difference between 'display: none;' and 'visibility: hidden;'?
    I think 'visiblity: hidden' doesn't stop an element from taking up space while 'display: none' does;
typeof() versus instanceof?
ressearch modules on the frontend

HTMLCollections are 'live' elements
    They update along with the dom, so if I define one at the top of my script, it might have a different value at some later point, even if I never modified it (but did modify the DOM).  So document.getElementsByClassName('.folders') will hold all the folders currently in the dom, not all the folders at the time of calling the method.
Who returns an HTMLCollection?
    getElementsByClassName
    getElementsByTagName
    children
HTMLCollections have an item() method, which means you can return an item from an index (and I think it also implies that you can use [index], for, and for/of)
HTMLCollections do not(!) have a forEach method
If you want to use forEach, or you want to require a frozen (i.e. not live) version of an HTMLCollection, convert it to an array using Array.from()
You can not add or remove elements from an HTMLCollection
